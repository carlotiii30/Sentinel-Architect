# Sentinel-Architect 🏗️🤖
*(Part of the Sentinel Security Suite)*

Sentinel-Architect is an AI-driven Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) generator designed to transform high-level security policies into production-ready technical configurations. By leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and LangChain, this tool ensures that security is baked into the infrastructure from the very first line of code.

## 🛰️ The Sentinel Ecosystem
This tool is part of a modular security suite designed for automated governance:
* **[Sentinel Auditor](https://github.com/carlotiii30/Sentinel-Auditor)**: Detective control that audits existing configurations.
* **Sentinel Architect** (This repo): Preventive control that generates secure IaC from natural language.

## 🌟 Project Overview
In a "Security by Design" framework, manual configuration is a risk. This project automates the creation of secure environments by translating administrative intent into precise technical files (Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes). It serves as the proactive counterpart to [Sentinel-Auditor](https://github.com/carlotiii30/Sentinel-Auditor), focusing on Preventive Controls as defined in the ISC2 CC curriculum.
