# Sentinel-Architect 🏗️🤖
Sentinel-Architect is an AI-driven Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) generator designed to transform high-level security policies into production-ready technical configurations. By leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and LangChain, this tool ensures that security is baked into the infrastructure from the very first line of code.

## 🌟 Project Overview
In a "Security by Design" framework, manual configuration is a risk. This project automates the creation of secure environments by translating administrative intent into precise technical files (Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes). It serves as the proactive counterpart to [Sentinel-Auditor](https://github.com/carlotiii30/Sentinel-Auditor), focusing on Preventive Controls as defined in the ISC2 CC curriculum.
